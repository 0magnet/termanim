// Package simscreen builds a tcell screen for tests to draw into and read back.
//
// tcell v2 shipped a SimulationScreen for exactly this and v3 does not. What v3
// has instead is better: a mock terminal in tcell/v3/vt that speaks the real
// protocol, so a screen built on it is an ordinary terminal screen rather than a
// separate implementation that might not behave like one.
//
// The screen's own Get reports the logical contents — what will be shown when
// Show is called — which is what SimulationScreen.GetContents reported, so the
// assertions written against it did not have to change. Reading the mock
// terminal's cells instead would test the emulator as well as the animation,
// and would mean converting its colours back out of image/color to compare
// them.

// being able to make a screen in a test, and the alternative is an error check
// at every call site that only ever reports a broken build.
